## Experiences
A a designer, I've heard of Wordpress and it's infamous "Wordpress Loop" but had never actually worked extensively with this CMS. I'm glad this project gave us an close and detailed look into Wordpress customisation and how to really extend it's capabilities beyond just a blogging platform. Learning the Wordpress Loop wasn't as intimidating as I was expecting and I'm really excited to learn more about the Wordpress REST API as the brief glimpse of this has shown some great implications for the future of Wordpress.

As a graphic designer (and now Web Developer) who has heard and seen the value of Wordpress, I can't wait to use this tool more in my future projects!
